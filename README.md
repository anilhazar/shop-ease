## How It Works / How It Designed to Work

Imagine a user named Anil, who has just discovered ShopEase. He decides to register an account to start shopping. With a few simple steps, Anil's personal details are securely saved, withhispassword encrypted using BCrypt to ensure maximum security.

Once logged in, Anil explores a variety of products. The product catalog is managed by the ShopEase admin, who can add, update, or soft delete products from the inventory. This means that even if a product is removed from the storefront, its data remains intact for future reference or auditing purposes.

Anil selects a few items He likes and adds them tohisshopping cart. The cart functionality is designed to handle these operations smoothly. If Anil decides to buy more of an item already inhiscart, the application updates the quantity instead of adding a duplicate entry, ensuring a user-friendly experience.

When Anil is ready to checkout, He places an order. ShopEase processes this order by confirming the availability of the products, updating stock levels, and calculating the total price. Anil can viewhisorder history and track the status ofhiscurrent orders throughhisaccount.

The backend system of ShopEase is robust, handling various tasks such as validating stock before adding a product, ensuring no redundant database queries, and managing soft deletes effectively. The systemâ€™s architecture is designed to provide a seamless experience for both customers and administrators, maintaining data integrity and performance throughout.
